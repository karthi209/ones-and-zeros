## Introduction

JWT (JSON Web Tokens) are an open standard for securely transmitting information between parties. In this article, we'll learn how JWT tokens are used for authentication.

## How JWT Works

JWT consists of three parts:
1. **Header**: Contains information about the algorithm used to sign the token.
2. **Payload**: Contains the claims (e.g., user information).
3. **Signature**: Used to verify the authenticity of the token.

## Example Code

```javascript
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

const token = jwt.sign({ userId: 123 }, 'your-secret-key', { expiresIn: '1h' });
console.log(token);

```
