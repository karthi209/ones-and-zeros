Avadi Corporation which is one of the four Municipal corporation inside the Chennai Metropolitan Area (others are GCC, Tambaram and Kanchipuram) is expanding. The Tamilnadu Govt has officially passed the GO dated 31-12-2024 - which can be found here [GO for expansion](https://www.tn.gov.in/kyg_template_tn/go.php?dep_id=MjE=&year=MjAyNA==).


The Avadi corporation will absorb three municipalities and **17 village panchayats** to expand from 65 sqkm to **180+ sqkm**. Greater Chennai Corporation on the other hand is adding 2 village panchayats to expand from *426 sqkm* area to 430 sqkm. I can see what the govt is going for. GCC is the premier corporation in Tamilnadu with budget expanding 4000+ crores per year and is is without adding any of the other components like Highway Dept budget, CMWSS budget etc, while the Avadi Corp and Tambaram corp, even though part of the bigger Chennai Metropolitan Area has a budget the size of a pea.


My hope is with Avadi expanding significatly, govt will be forced to focus more as the counsellors and teh size and power of mayor will increase or atleast that's what I'm hoping.

Here's a map of the newly expanded areas along with the existing corp boundaries.

Here's the overall boundaries of the three corporations after the expansion.
